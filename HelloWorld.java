/*
 * What does the `main()` method represent in a Java program?
 * -> The `main()` method is the entry point of a Java application.
 *    When a Java program runs, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for `main()`
 *    to start executing the code.
 *
 * Why is System.out.println() used to display output?
 * -> `System.out.println()` is a built-in Java method that prints text to the console.
 *    - `System` refers to the system environment.
 *    - `out` is the standard output stream.
 *    - `println()` prints a line of text and moves the cursor to the next line.
 *
 * What is the purpose of comments in the program?
 * -> Comments help explain what the code does.
 *    They are ignored by the compiler and exist only to help developers understand the program.
 *    - Single-line comments: // This is a comment.
 *    - Multi-line comments: /* This is a comment block. */
